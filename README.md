### [Week 2](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%202)
1. Talked about how [HTML Forms send data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data). Used [urlencoded](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/server.js#L28-L29) middleware to turn form data from a string to an object on the request called [req.body](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/controllers/fruitController.js#L22-L28). Added [post, put, and delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L18-L25) routes. Setup a special [method-override](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/server.js#L19-L20) library allow for [PUT](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L7) and [DELETE](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Show.jsx#L16-L18) requests in HTML Forms. Finished controller logic for [delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L7) and [update](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/controllers/fruitController.js#L47-L62) routes. Added functional components for [edit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx) and [new](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/New.jsx) views as well.
1. Created a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) account. Copied the [connection string](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/.example.env#L10) to the database, setup a [config](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/config/db.js) file, and [ran the config module in the server](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/server.js#L12-L16). Created a [Schema](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/models/fruitModel.js) for fruit in the models folder. Used the [Fruit model](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L3-L11) to interact with the database in the controller. Used the [_id property](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/views/fruits/Index.jsx#L12) in the anchor tag and forms of index and show view.
1. Finished controller logic of [delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L60-L70) and [update](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L84-L103) and adjusted form actions in [Show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Show.jsx#L17) and [Edit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L9) view. Added [seed](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L105-L116) and [clear](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L118-L128) logic in controller with [corresponding routes](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L18-L28) for testing and development purposes. Designed a [DefaultLayout](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx) component to [wrap others](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Index.jsx#L8-L32) using [props.children](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx) and provide [styling](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx#L9) and a [navbar](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx#L12-L19). Stored css in a [public folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/public) and used middleware to tell express to find [static files](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L43-L44) there. Also created a [custom middleware](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L46-L51) using [next](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L50).
1. Worked on [Captain's Log](https://perscholas.instructure.com/courses/1249/assignments/282998) and [Poke Express](https://perscholas.instructure.com/courses/1249/assignments/282414) in groups

### [Week 1](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201)
1. Presented [MOD 2 Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Ad-CyyfNtMFTs2hjjcrbY3zSbv7odg3z4etzNCPuRU/edit#gid=0) 
1. Went over [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), the [require](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/node-practice/script.js#L27-L29) function, using [module.exports](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/node-practice/days-of-the-week.js#L4-L11), created an [express app](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express-practice/server-template.js), and explored [URL Params](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express_plants/server.js#L26-L29) and [Query Params](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express_plants/server.js#L18-L24)
1. Talked about [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud), [MVC](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc), and [REST](https://medium.com/@atingenkay/restful-routes-what-are-they-8fe221521bb). Used [filter](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L19-L24) and Query Params together in a [food app](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app). Also, separated data into a [models](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/models) folder and used the data for [index](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L34-L37) and [show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L39-L42) routes
1. Separated routes into a [routes folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes), connected them to the [express router](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L3-L4), learned how to organize them with [I.N.D.U.C.E.S](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L9-L10), and moved the [callback logic](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/controllers/fruitController.js#L4-L11) into a [controllers folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/controllers). Setup a [view engine](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/server.js#L16-L23) in the server.js and added a [views folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views) with a functional component for an [index](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views/fruits/Index.jsx) and [show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views/fruits/Show.jsx) view
