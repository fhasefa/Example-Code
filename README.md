### [Week 4](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%204)
1. Combined the login auth with the blog app. Used [axios.create](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%204/Day%201%20(Mon)/fullstack-blog-with-auth/client/src/services/api.js#L10-L21) to return a custom axios with a [BaseURL](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%204/Day%201%20(Mon)/fullstack-blog-with-auth/client/src/services/api.js#L3-L8) and an Authorization header. Added [conditional logic](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%204/Day%201%20(Mon)/fullstack-blog-with-auth/client/src/pages/posts/Show.js#L67-L72) to client to restrict certain actions (like update and delete) to logged in users. Added [another middleware](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%204/Day%201%20(Mon)/fullstack-blog-with-auth/backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js#L41-L56) to ensure the logged in user owns the requested resource. Went over [steps to deploy](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%204/Day%201%20(Mon)/fullstack-blog-with-auth/client/README.md) the frontend and backend with [render.com](https://render.com/).
1. Started work on [MOD 3 Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-Rft-gdjkla99zZiyel5yCF6xc6AARH5ppiSG6jg80/edit#gid=0).

### [Week 3](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203)
1. Customized schemas to implement [embedded documents](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-embedded/models/postModel.js#L21-L26) and [referenced documents](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-referenced/models/postModel.js#L10-L15) in a [One-To-Many](https://blog.supportgroup.com/getting-started-with-relational-databases-one-to-one-and-many-to-many-relationships) relationship. Examples of the [\$push](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-embedded/controllers/postController.js#L58-L61), the [\$pull](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-embedded/controllers/postController.js#L69-L76), the [\$in](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-referenced/controllers/postController.js#L25-L26), and the [\$set](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-embedded/controllers/postController.js#L101-L105) MongoDB operators. Using [.save()](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-embedded/controllers/postController.js#L108-L113) as an alternative to update or create documents. Turning reference ids into documents objects with the [populate](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%201%20(Mon)/blog-posts-referenced/controllers/postController.js#L54-L55) method.
1. Seperated server logic into a [backend](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend) folder and the React frontend logic of an old Todo App into a [client](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/client) folder. Installed a [cors package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) to be [used as middleware](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L14-L15) to allow for client requests. Used fetch on the client to make a [GET request](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/client/src/App.js#L14-L20) to the [index route](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L20-L28), a [POST request](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/client/src/App.js#L37-L43) to the [create route](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L30-L39), a [DELETE request](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/client/src/App.js#L59-L61) to the [destroy route](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L41-L49), and a [PUT request](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/client/src/App.js#L74-L80) to the [update route](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L51-L59). Sent back a response with [res.json](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L24) and formatted the req.body with [express.json](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/backend/server.js#L17-L18) middleware. Installed the [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) package and [setup scripts](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%202%20(Tue)/fullstack-todos-basic/package.json#L8-L11) to start the client and server at the same time.
1. Returned to the [Blog App](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example) and split it into backend and client folders. Saw how [react router handles the rendering](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/App.js#L14-L21) and [fetches data on page load](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/pages/posts/Index.js#L9-L19) using useEffect. Replaced the action and method of the form with event handlers like [onSubmit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/pages/posts/New.js#L24) and put the request logic in functions like [handleSubmit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/pages/posts/New.js#L11-L19). Created [services](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/services) folder to abstract logic away from components and installed the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) package to make [easier fetch calls](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/client/src/services/postService.js#L31-L32). Saw how [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) can help test backend routes and learned that [{ new: true }](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%203%20(Wed)/fullstack-blog-example/backend/controllers/postController.js#L30) can be passed as a third argument to an update.
1. Created a [Login-Auth App](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%203/Day%204%20(Thur)/login-auth-starter) to demonstrate [authentication](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authentication) and [authorization](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authorization). Worked on logic for [login](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%204%20(Thur)/login-auth-starter/backend/controllers/authController.js#L37-L67) and [register](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%204%20(Thur)/login-auth-starter/backend/controllers/authController.js#L6-L35) routes in the backend using libraries like [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to encrypt user passwords and [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken) to create [JWT](https://jwt.io/) strings. Saved JWT in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) and sent it as part of the [Authorization header](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%204%20(Thur)/login-auth-starter/client/src/pages/Login.js#L30-L34) of requests. Made a custom [authorize middleware](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%203/Day%204%20(Thur)/login-auth-starter/backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js) and attached it to user routes. Also added [status codes](https://www.webfx.com/web-development/glossary/http-status-codes/) like 400 and 200 to responses.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%202)
1. Talked about how [HTML Forms send data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data). Used [urlencoded](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/server.js#L28-L29) middleware to turn form data from a string to an object on the request called [req.body](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/controllers/fruitController.js#L22-L28). Added [post, put, and delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L18-L25) routes. Setup a special [method-override](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/server.js#L19-L20) library allow for [PUT](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L7) and [DELETE](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Show.jsx#L16-L18) requests in HTML Forms. Finished controller logic for [delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L7) and [update](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/controllers/fruitController.js#L47-L62) routes. Added functional components for [edit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/Edit.jsx) and [new](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%201%20(Mon)/food-mvc-two/views/fruits/New.jsx) views as well
1. Created a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) account. Copied the [connection string](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/.example.env#L10) to the database, setup a [config](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/config/db.js) file, and [ran the config module in the server](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/server.js#L12-L16). Created a [Schema](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/models/fruitModel.js) for fruit in the models folder. Used the [Fruit model](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L3-L11) to interact with the database in the controller. Used the [_id property](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%202%20(Tue)/food-mvc-mongo/views/fruits/Index.jsx#L12) in the anchor tag and forms of index and show view
1. Finished controller logic of [delete](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L60-L70) and [update](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L84-L103) and adjusted form actions in [Show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Show.jsx#L17) and [Edit](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Edit.jsx#L9) view. Added [seed](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L105-L116) and [clear](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/controllers/fruitController.js#L118-L128) logic in controller with [corresponding routes](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L18-L28) for testing and development purposes. Designed a [DefaultLayout](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx) component to [wrap others](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/fruits/Index.jsx#L8-L32) using [props.children](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx) and provide [styling](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx#L9) and a [navbar](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/views/layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx#L12-L19). Stored css in a [public folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/public) and used middleware to tell express to find [static files](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L43-L44) there. Also created a [custom middleware](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L46-L51) using [next](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%202/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-full-mongo/server.js#L50)
1. Worked on [Captain's Log](https://perscholas.instructure.com/courses/1249/assignments/282998) and [Poke Express](https://perscholas.instructure.com/courses/1249/assignments/282414) in groups

### [Week 1](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201)
1. Presented [MOD 2 Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Ad-CyyfNtMFTs2hjjcrbY3zSbv7odg3z4etzNCPuRU/edit#gid=0) 
1. Went over [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), the [require](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/node-practice/script.js#L27-L29) function, using [module.exports](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/node-practice/days-of-the-week.js#L4-L11), created an [express app](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express-practice/server-template.js), and explored [URL Params](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express_plants/server.js#L26-L29) and [Query Params](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%202%20(Tue)/express_plants/server.js#L18-L24)
1. Talked about [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud), [MVC](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc), and [REST](https://medium.com/@atingenkay/restful-routes-what-are-they-8fe221521bb). Used [filter](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L19-L24) and Query Params together in a [food app](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app). Also, separated data into a [models](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/models) folder and used the data for [index](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L34-L37) and [show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%203%20(Wed)/food-app/server.js#L39-L42) routes
1. Separated routes into a [routes folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes), connected them to the [express router](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L3-L4), learned how to organize them with [I.N.D.U.C.E.S](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/routes/fruitRoutes.js#L9-L10), and moved the [callback logic](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/controllers/fruitController.js#L4-L11) into a [controllers folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/controllers). Setup a [view engine](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/server.js#L16-L23) in the server.js and added a [views folder](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/tree/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views) with a functional component for an [index](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views/fruits/Index.jsx) and [show](https://github.com/JadeTwo/Example-Code/blob/main/Week%201/Day%204%20(Thur)/food-app-mvc/views/fruits/Show.jsx) view
